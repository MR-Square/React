Title : Creating React app

1 - How to create a react app?
    To create a react app we use following commands:
    npm install create-react-app app_name
    npx install create-react-app app_name

2 - What is the difference between npm and npx?
    In simple word npm takes computer storage but npx does not.

3 - What are props?
    Props(properties) are arguments passed into React components.
    e.g:
    I have a form with some fields. When I will send that form with values filled in that fields then these values are nothing but props.
